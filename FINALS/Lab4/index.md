# Finals Lab Task 4. 
**Python GUI using TKINTER**


<br>


**Note:** Write your code following **OOP code construct**, you may use the attached simpleCalc.py program as guide.


<br>


## Instruction

**READ AND UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM FIRST BEFORE DOING THE PROGRAM**  
  
- Design the form below  
- **Problem Statement**: The cost of a long distance is based on the destination, the time of the day was made, as well as the distance of the call. The rates as follow:  
  
|DAYTIME CALLS|NIGHTIME CALLS|  
|:---:|:---:|  
|American Region  ₱ 50 every 3 minutes|American Region  ₱ 45 every 3 minutes|  
|Asian Region  ₱30 every 2 minutes|Asian Region  ₱ 27 every 2 minutes|  
|African Region  ₱ 40 every 3 minutes|African Region  ₱ 36 every 3 minutes|  
|European Region  ₱ 35 every 2 minutes|European Region  ₱ 30 every 2 minutes|  
  
- Make a program that will Allow the user to **Select Destination Code (between 1 – 4)** using ComboBox widget, A Time Code using radio buttons, And the Duration Of The Call in minutes and output the **TOTAL CHARGE.** 
  - Validate user inputs by using TRY EXCEPT block 
  - Only numeric values are accepted.
- **Compute Button** should compute for the **TOTAL CHARGE**.  
  - Computations should be based on the table rates shown above. (The total charge is based on Length of Calls, Destination Code and Time Code)
  - You may use the get() method of the comboBox to capture the selected option in your comboBox
- **Reset Button** should clear the Radio Button Selection and the Text field entries should be cleared as well
- **About Button** should display a dialog with the message: “Hello I’m your Name” 
- See Sample Image below:
